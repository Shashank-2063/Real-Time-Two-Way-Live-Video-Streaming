# 📹 Real-Time Two-Way Live Video Streaming

A web-based application that enables **real-time, peer-to-peer two-way video and audio communication** using **WebRTC**, **WebSocket signaling**, and **JavaScript**. It allows two users to connect via a shared room ID and exchange live streams seamlessly.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Join a room with a unique Room ID
- 📞 Establish secure, low-latency P2P video calls
- 🖥️ Clean UI with local and remote video panels

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User A and User B open the app and enter the same **Room ID**
2. A WebSocket connection is established for signaling
3. WebRTC handles P2P negotiation via offer/answer and ICE candidates
4. Media streams are exchanged and rendered on both sides
